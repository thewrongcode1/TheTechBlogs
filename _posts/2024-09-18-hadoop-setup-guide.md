## Introduction to Hadoop

In this guide, we will walk you through the entire process of setting up a Hadoop environment, exploring its architecture, and providing code examples to help you understand its key concepts.

### Step 1: Install Hadoop

```bash
# Update packages and install Java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk

# Download Hadoop
wget https://downloads.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.0/hadoop-3.3.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf hadoop-3.3.0.tar.gz
```

### Step 2: Configuring Hadoop

Edit the `core-site.xml` file:

```xml
<configuration>
   <property>
      <name>fs.default.name</name>
      <value>hdfs://localhost:9000</value>
   </property>
</configuration>
```

### Step 3: Start Hadoop Services

```bash
# Format the namenode
hdfs namenode -format

# Start the Hadoop services
start-dfs.sh
start-yarn.sh
```

That's it! You've successfully set up Hadoop. Check back for more in-depth tutorials on working with Big Data.
